# Meshery Schemas — Coding Agent Instructions

This is the central schema repository for the Meshery platform. Schemas here drive Go struct generation, TypeScript type generation, and RTK Query client generation. Mistakes in schema design propagate into generated code across multiple downstream repos (meshery/meshery, layer5io/meshery-cloud).

## Build

```bash
make build       # generate Go structs + TypeScript types + RTK clients
npm run build    # build TypeScript distribution (dist/)
```

Generated artifacts (`models/`, `typescript/generated/`) are committed by automation on `master`. The TypeScript distribution in `dist/` is produced by the npm build/publish workflow and is not committed to this repo. Do not edit generated artifacts by hand, and do not manually commit regenerated output in normal PRs unless the change explicitly requires it.

## The Dual-Schema Pattern (REQUIRED)

This is the most critical design rule in this repo. Every agent or contributor MUST follow it.

### Rule 1: `<construct>.yaml` = response schema only

The YAML file for an entity represents the **full server-side object** as returned in API responses. It is NOT a request body schema.

**Required properties of every entity `.yaml`:**

- `additionalProperties: false` at the top level
- All server-generated fields defined in `properties`: `id`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `deleted_at`
- Server-generated fields that are always present belong in `required`

```yaml
# CORRECT: keychain.yaml
type: object
additionalProperties: false
required:
  - id
  - name
  - owner
  - created_at
  - updated_at
properties:
  id:
    $ref: ../../v1alpha1/core/api.yml#/components/schemas/uuid
  name:
    type: string
  owner:
    $ref: ../../v1alpha1/core/api.yml#/components/schemas/uuid
  created_at:
    $ref: ../../v1alpha1/core/api.yml#/components/schemas/created_at
  updated_at:
    $ref: ../../v1alpha1/core/api.yml#/components/schemas/updated_at
  deleted_at:
    $ref: ../../v1alpha1/core/api.yml#/components/schemas/nullTime
```

### Rule 2: Every writable entity needs a `*Payload` schema in `api.yml`

For any entity that has `POST` or `PUT` operations, define a `{Construct}Payload` schema in `api.yml` that:

- Contains **only client-settable fields** — no `created_at`, `updated_at`, `deleted_at`
- Makes `id` optional with `json:"id,omitempty"` for upsert patterns
- Is the schema referenced by all `requestBody` entries for `POST`/`PUT`

```yaml
# CORRECT: in api.yml
components:
  schemas:
    KeychainPayload:
      type: object
      description: Payload for creating or updating a keychain.
      required:
        - name
      properties:
        id:
          $ref: ../../v1alpha1/core/api.yml#/components/schemas/uuid
          description: Existing keychain ID for updates; omit on create.
          x-oapi-codegen-extra-tags:
            json: "id,omitempty"
        name:
          type: string
        owner:
          $ref: ../../v1alpha1/core/api.yml#/components/schemas/uuid
          x-oapi-codegen-extra-tags:
            json: "owner,omitempty"
```

### Rule 3: POST/PUT requestBody MUST reference `*Payload`, never the entity schema

```yaml
# WRONG — forces clients to supply server-generated fields
post:
  requestBody:
    content:
      application/json:
        schema:
          $ref: "#/components/schemas/Keychain"

# CORRECT — separate payload type for writes
post:
  requestBody:
    content:
      application/json:
        schema:
          $ref: "#/components/schemas/KeychainPayload"
```

### Canonical reference implementations

When uncertain, model new schemas on these:

- `schemas/constructs/v1beta1/connection/` — `connection.yaml` + `ConnectionPayload` in `api.yml`
- `schemas/constructs/v1beta1/key/` — `key.yaml` + `KeyPayload` in `api.yml`
- `schemas/constructs/v1beta1/team/` — `team.yaml` + `teamPayload`/`teamUpdatePayload` in `api.yml`
- `schemas/constructs/v1beta1/environment/` — `environment.yaml` + `environmentPayload` in `api.yml`

## Checklist for new entity schemas

Before opening a PR, verify:

- [ ] `<construct>.yaml` has `additionalProperties: false`
- [ ] `<construct>.yaml` lists all server-generated fields in `properties` and appropriate ones in `required`
- [ ] `api.yml` defines `{Construct}Payload` with only client-settable fields
- [ ] All `POST`/`PUT` `requestBody` entries reference `{Construct}Payload`
- [ ] `GET` responses reference the full `{Construct}` entity schema

## Naming conventions

- Property names: `camelCase` (`schemaVersion`, `displayName`)
- ID-suffix fields: `lowerCamelCase` + `Id` (`modelId`, `registrantId`)
- Enums: lowercase words (`enabled`, `ignored`, `duplicate`)
- Object names: singular nouns (`model`, `component`, `design`)
- `components/schemas` names: PascalCase nouns (`Model`, `Component`, `KeychainPayload`)
- Files/folders: lowercase (`api.yml`, `keychain.yaml`, `templates/keychain_template.json`)
- Endpoint paths: `/api` prefix, kebab-case, plural nouns (`/api/workspaces`, `/api/environments`)
- Path params: camelCase with `Id` suffix (`{subscriptionId}`, `{connectionId}`, `{orgId}` — NOT `{orgID}`, NOT `{org_id}`)
- `operationId`: lower camelCase verbNoun (`createKeychain`, `updateEnvironment` — NOT `CreateKeychain`, NOT `UpdateEnvironment`)

## Casing rules at a glance

Every element in the API has exactly one correct casing. The table below is the single authoritative reference:

| Element | Casing | Example | Counter-example |
|---|---|---|---|
| Schema property names (non-DB) | camelCase | `schemaVersion`, `displayName` | ~~`schema_version`~~, ~~`SchemaVersion`~~ |
| ID-suffix properties | camelCase + `Id` | `modelId`, `registrantId` | ~~`modelID`~~, ~~`model_id`~~ |
| DB-mirrored fields | snake_case | `created_at`, `updated_at`, `user_id` | ~~`createdAt`~~ |
| Enum values | lowercase | `enabled`, `ignored` | ~~`Enabled`~~, ~~`ENABLED`~~ |
| `components/schemas` names | PascalCase | `ModelDefinition`, `KeychainPayload` | ~~`modelDefinition`~~ |
| File and folder names | lowercase | `api.yml`, `keychain.yaml` | ~~`Keychain.yaml`~~ |
| Path segments | kebab-case, plural nouns | `/api/role-holders` | ~~`/api/roleHolders`~~ |
| Path parameters | camelCase + `Id` | `{orgId}`, `{workspaceId}` | ~~`{orgID}`~~, ~~`{org_id}`~~ |
| `operationId` | lower camelCase verbNoun | `getAllRoles`, `createWorkspace` | ~~`GetAllRoles`~~, ~~`get_all_roles`~~ |
| Go type names | PascalCase (generated) | `Connection`, `KeychainPayload` | — |
| Go field names | PascalCase (generated) | `CreatedAt`, `UpdatedAt` | — |
| TypeScript type names | PascalCase (generated) | `Connection`, `KeychainPayload` | — |

**snake\_case is only for DB-mirrored fields** — `created_at`, `updated_at`, `deleted_at`, `user_id`, and similar fields that map directly to a database column named with underscores. All other names follow the rules above.

## HTTP API Design Principles

These rules govern how endpoints are structured. They are enforced in part by `make validate-schemas`.

### HTTP method semantics

| Use case | Method | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Create a resource | `POST` | `POST /api/workspaces` → 201 |
| Upsert a resource | `POST` | `POST /api/keys` → 200 |
| Update an existing resource | `PUT` or `PATCH` | `PUT /api/workspaces/{workspaceId}` → 200 |
| Non-CRUD action on a resource | `POST` to a sub-resource path | `POST /api/invitations/{invitationId}/accept` |
| Bulk delete | `POST` to a `/delete` sub-resource | `POST /api/designs/delete` → 200 |
| Single delete | `DELETE` | `DELETE /api/keys/{keyId}` → 204 |

**Do NOT use `DELETE` with a request body for bulk operations.** REST semantics do not define a request body for `DELETE`; many HTTP clients and proxies strip it silently. Use a `POST /api/{resources}/delete` sub-resource instead:

```yaml
# WRONG — DELETE with a request body
delete:
  operationId: deletePatterns
  requestBody:
    content:
      application/json:
        schema:
          $ref: '#/components/schemas/PatternIds'

# CORRECT — POST sub-resource for bulk delete
post:
  operationId: deletePatterns
  summary: Bulk delete patterns by ID
  requestBody:
    content:
      application/json:
        schema:
          $ref: '#/components/schemas/PatternIds'
  responses:
    "200":
      description: Patterns deleted
```

### HTTP response codes

| Code | Meaning | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| 200 | OK | Request succeeded; body contains the result (queries, upserts, actions) |
| 201 | Created | A new resource was created; body contains the new resource |
| 202 | Accepted | Request received; operation will complete asynchronously |
| 204 | No Content | Request succeeded; no response body (e.g., a single-resource `DELETE`) |

Use **201** (not 200) for `POST` endpoints that exclusively create a new resource. Use **200** for upsert operations where the resource may already exist.

### Resource grouping and path structure

Endpoints are grouped into logical categories under `/api`:

| Category prefix | Domain |
|---|---|
| `/api/identity/` | Users, orgs, roles, teams, invitations |
| `/api/integrations/` | Connections, environments, credentials |
| `/api/content/` | Designs, views, components, models |
| `/api/entitlement/` | Plans, subscriptions, features |
| `/api/auth/` | Tokens, keychains, keys |

New endpoints must be placed in the appropriate category. Path segments must be kebab-case plural nouns matching the resource name.

## File structure for a construct

```shell
schemas/constructs/v1beta1/<construct>/
  api.yml                          # OpenAPI spec: endpoints + all schema definitions
  <construct>.yaml                 # Entity (response) schema
  templates/
    <construct>_template.json      # Example instance
    <construct>_template.yaml
```

## Go helper files

Auto-generated Go structs (`models/<version>/<construct>/<construct>.go`) are committed by the artifact-generation workflow on `master`. Do not edit them by hand; the manually written helpers below are the files contributors should maintain directly:

```shell
models/v1beta1/<construct>/
  <construct>.go          # Auto-generated — DO NOT edit
  <construct>_helper.go   # Manual — add SQL driver, Entity interface, TableName(), etc.
```

Always add `// This is not autogenerated.` at the top of helper files.

Use `x-generate-db-helpers: true` on a schema component to auto-generate `Scan`/`Value` SQL driver methods for types stored as JSON blobs in a single DB column. Do NOT use this for types mapped to full DB tables.

## x-internal annotation

Control which bundled output includes an API path:

- `x-internal: ["cloud"]` — cloud-only (`_openapi_build/cloud_openapi.yml`)
- `x-internal: ["meshery"]` — Meshery-only (`_openapi_build/meshery_openapi.yml`)
- Omit `x-internal` — included in both bundled outputs

See [The Dual-Schema Pattern](#the-dual-schema-pattern-required) above for the canonical entity/payload rules and reference examples used throughout this repo.

## SQL Driver (`Scan`/`Value`) Implementation Rules

When manually implementing `sql.Scanner` and `driver.Valuer` for map-like types:

### Preferred rule: serialize instead of returning SQL NULL from `Value()`

`core.Map` marshals nil maps to the JSON string `"null"` instead of SQL NULL. Prefer the same behavior for new or updated helpers unless the column is explicitly nullable and the nil-vs-empty distinction is required and documented.

```go
// CORRECT — matches core.Map pattern
func (m MapObject) Value() (driver.Value, error) {
    b, err := json.Marshal(m)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    return string(b), nil
}

// WRONG — writes SQL NULL, inconsistent with core.Map
func (m MapObject) Value() (driver.Value, error) {
    if m == nil {
        return nil, nil   // <- do not do this
    }
    ...
}
```

### Preferred rule: zero the receiver on nil src in `Scan()`

When `src` is nil (SQL NULL), new or updated `Scan` implementations should explicitly zero the receiver. Some legacy helpers return early, but clearing the receiver avoids stale data if the same struct is reused across rows.

```go
// CORRECT
case nil:
    *m = nil
    return nil

// WRONG — leaves stale data
case nil:
    return nil
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. ❌ Hand-editing generated Go code in `models/` directory
2. ❌ Hand-editing generated TypeScript code in `typescript/generated/` directory
3. ❌ Hand-editing built files in `dist/` directory
4. ❌ Using deprecated `core.json` references
5. ❌ Adding redundant `x-oapi-codegen-extra-tags` when using schema references
6. ❌ Forgetting to update template files in the `templates/` subdirectory with default values
7. ❌ Not testing the build process after schema changes
8. ❌ Placing template files outside the `templates/` subdirectory
9. ❌ Using `.d.ts` extension in TypeScript import paths
10. ❌ Assuming schema property names are PascalCase (check actual generated `.d.ts` files)
11. ❌ Adding `x-generate-db-helpers` on individual properties — it must be at the schema component level
12. ❌ Using `x-generate-db-helpers` on amorphous types without a fixed schema — use `x-go-type: "core.Map"` instead
13. ❌ Using the full entity schema as a `POST`/`PUT` `requestBody` — always use a separate `*Payload` schema
14. ❌ Omitting `additionalProperties: false` from entity `<construct>.yaml` files
15. ❌ Adding new `Value()` implementations that return `(nil, nil)` unless SQL NULL behavior is explicitly required and documented
16. ❌ In new `Scan()` implementations, returning without zeroing the receiver when `src` is nil
17. ❌ Using PascalCase for new `operationId` values — always lower camelCase (`getPatterns`, not `GetPatterns`)
18. ❌ Using SCREAMING\_CASE path parameters (`{orgID}`, `{roleID}`) — always camelCase with `Id` suffix (`{orgId}`, `{roleId}`)
19. ❌ Using `DELETE` with a request body for bulk operations — use `POST /api/{resources}/delete` instead
20. ❌ Returning 200 from a `POST` that exclusively creates a new resource — use 201

## Questions?

If you're unsure about any schema modification:

1. Check existing schemas for patterns (e.g., `environment.yaml`, `connection.yaml`)
2. Look at `schemas/constructs/v1alpha1/core/api.yml` for available core schema definitions
3. Examine any construct's `api.yml` to see how subschemas are referenced and endpoints are defined
4. Check generated `.d.ts` files for actual type/property names
5. Review this document for guidelines
6. Test your changes with `make build` before committing
